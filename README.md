# verticalize

As a first git deposit, I wrote this little program capable of transforming any terminal output vertically, i.e. the horizontal text is translated vertically.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* a terminal
* a c compiler

It runs in a terminal as a command line program.
It is a c file, it can therefore be compiled on any system (I guess). On linux use can gcc.

### Warning

No special warning unless I have to improve the code to make it work with big files.
However, the aim is to output small texts in a terminal window and therefore converting big amount of text does not really make sense.

### Installing

The file can be compiled with gcc on linux by running the following commands:

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

For cleaning things do a simple:
```
make clean
```

### Use

Syntax is the following:

```
verticalize [FILE]
```

You can also pipe into verticalize like:
```
cat [FILE] | verticalize
```

Or simply run the following to enter some text and end with Enter and EOF signal (CTRL-D):
```
verticalize
```
